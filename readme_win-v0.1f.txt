Here you go! Another copy of the great game!
It's freeware. May become GPL'd some day, if anyone wants my code...

------------------------
Wtf is this game about!?
------------------------
Well, either you take your car and run over all the people in the map,

or, you PLAY IT OVER A NETWORK!!!!
YES! IT'S TRUE!!! YOU ARE NOW ABLE TO PLAY THIS TERRIFIC GAME OVER A NETWORK!!!

Only 2 players, though.

If you get tired of that, you can always find 
some bugs hidden in the software :)
Report them to me, so i can make this gamemode harder :)


-----------------------
More about the network:
-----------------------
You can be 2 players.
The server uses port 32434 to listen for connections.

WARNING! If you start a server, and no client connects to it, 
it won't respond.
Soltuion: CTRL-ALT-DEL ;)


The "playing" is not optimized(what is?), which means that it's not
as fun as it should be... (if it's any fun at all)

And, the network routines could be faster, but.. :)

How to get a point:
--------------------
If the other car crashes, you get a point after respawn.
If you crashes, the othercar get a point when you respawn.

How to get the lowest damage when crashing is up to you to find out...

Very advanced... ;)


----------------------------------------
Jag är en banan och fattar inte engelska:
----------------------------------------
Aj då.

Buttons:
--------

ENTER	Respawn when you are dead.
TAB	The horn (tutan)
SPACE	Brake
Arrows	Steering... I think you get the point :)
